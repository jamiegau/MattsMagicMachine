# MattsMagicMachine
An Arduino project to monitor and control devices

This Project involved using an Arduino to:
1. monitor external inputs, typically tempurature inputs
2. Allow monitored inputs to be remotely viewable via a webpage
3. Show monitored input data available via Nextion LCD display.
4. Control 3x 240 volt power points so they can be remotly activated and controlled based on monitored conditions. (Too hot/cold turns on/off the power.)
5. store historical (On the SD card) data that can be viewed via the web page.
6. Allow editing og setup variable (probe addresses as an example) via the web page and stored on the SD card.
